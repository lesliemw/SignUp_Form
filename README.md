Another simple project to really test my HTML and CSS skills.

Also included in this project was my favorite---Bootstrap.

This project featured a signup form which required a first name, last name, email, and password to sign up for my website.

By adding the simple word "required" to the html, it also performed minor form validation. If the user attempted to submit the form without a required field being field in, they would see an error message.

What have I learned from this project?
--I should have approached this from a mobile-first POV, as it is much easier to scale up than down.
--I need to brush up on my Javascript skills. This would have allowed me to do more intricate form validation, which would have included a fancier error message and password requirements.
